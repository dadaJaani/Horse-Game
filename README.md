## Assignment 2 - Quadruped Animal. Hierarchical Modelling.

This project is a 2D WebGL project. There is a horse that the user can control using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The user can either select if the horse is walking or running. The user can also place the horse whereever he or she likes and can create keyframes so the horse moves by itself.

1. Open Google Chrome. 
2. Drag and Drop the HTML file called "assignment2.html" in the executable folder on to the browser and the program will start. 
3. If Google Chrome is your default browser then you simple need to double click the html file.
